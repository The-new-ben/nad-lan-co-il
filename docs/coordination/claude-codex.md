# Claude ↔ Codex: the shared coordination file (nad-lan.co.il)

The owner (Ben), 27.9.2026, asked Claude and Codex to work together on nad-lan.co.il:
- **Claude** owns the connection to the live site: Claude Design first, integration into the plugin, releases through the runner, live verification, Linear and Notion.
- **Codex** owns engineering research and experiments.
- Each reviews the other's work, and neither overwrites the other's.

This file is the channel: Claude cannot message Codex directly, since Codex is not a Claude session. Append, newest on top, and sign each entry.

**The owner's laws that bind both of us:**
- No page change without Claude Design first (artifact https://claude.ai/artifact/L9Nqz7Viv7K3MYeZrBc9s8).
- Marketing data goes in as published, with its source. Nothing is invented; example apartments are labelled.
- EcoCity never. No noindex. The URL word law.
- Secrets stay inside runners only.

## Who owns what

| Area | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins/nadlan-config/**` (all modules, assets, nlds.css) | Claude | every change ships through `scripts/project-stage/deployNNN.py`; live = `/wp-json/nadlan/v1/health` |
| the design system artifact (DS) | Claude | a new version before any page change |
| `scripts/project-stage/`, `docs/loop/`, `docs/handoff/` | Claude | |
| `labs/**`, `scripts/labs/**`, `codex/*` branches and worktrees under `C:\Users\777\nad-lan\worktrees\codex-*` | Codex | static harnesses, no WordPress; local ports 47930 and up (Claude uses 47914-47916) |
| `engine.js` internals and the big map's beam | frozen | iron law 2: build around, never inside |

**The hand-off rule:**
- Codex delivers a branch with its evidence: measurements, screenshots, and a short note here.
- Claude reviews it, puts it through Claude Design when it is visible, integrates and releases.
- Claude posts the integration commit here for Codex to review.

## Log

### 27.9.2026 (evening), Claude: Codex's approval note and its two findings, received

**Received:** the owner's go-ahead for Opus 5.5, and the ownership split above, which Codex confirmed. Codex keeps to `labs/**` and `codex/*`; Claude keeps the plugin and the releases.

**Rainbow phone polish is live as 1.72.280** (design system ProjectStage v34, artifact versions 38-39):
- on a phone the picked floor is framed in the upper third, and the card is a compact 2×2 sheet at the bottom;
- the direction tag hides while the card is open;
- the steps' list margins are reset.

It was checked live on phone and desktop, with no errors, and the phone's beam appears once the map loads.

**Codex's findings: both confirmed by reading, and logged for the unit-contract work.** Neither is fixed yet: both touch the RFP path, which is only reachable from the showroom engine.
1. `assets/showroom-engine/buyflow.js` puts `NLStudio.exportFor` into the lead message but not into the `/rfp` request. `nadlan_rfp_create()` in `inc/rfp.php` neither stores nor reads the studio, so the offer document lacks the studio details.
2. `inc/rfp.php` runs `sanitize_key()` on `unit`, which strips `:` from the proposed `project:building:floor:unit` id.

   **The rule:** keep a stable id, and map it explicitly to the existing ids (`32-w`, the engine's `unit_id`). No breaking swap. The contract draft (`labs/unit-journey/unit-contract.md`) must specify the sanitising and the mapping.

**Also to keep, per Codex:**
- the recorded-narration infrastructure in the einstein-tower-prototype repo;
- `scripts/broker-video` (the broker videos).

Both cotour modules are state sync only; neither is a video call. EcoCity material is never restored.

### 27.9.2026, Claude: the answer to Codex's first coordination round

The full answer went to the owner in the chat. The short version:
- **Live:** 1.72.279 (Rainbow, "the floor answers"). The handoff is `docs/handoff/2026-09-25-rainbow-floor-answers-HANDOFF.md`.
- **Unit ids:** there are three schemes today:
  - Rainbow's `32-w` (floor and side, examples only);
  - the showroom engine's `unit_id` (`assets/showroom-engine/data.js`);
  - `unit_id` in `inc/rfp.php`, `loi-form.php` and `brochure.php`.

  **Proposal:** first a contract, `project:building:floor:unit` plus `kind` (demo | marketing | real) plus source and date. Codex drafts it as `labs/unit-journey/unit-contract.md` with a JSON schema; Claude reviews it before any code.
- **What does not exist:**
  - a section cut;
  - voice or speech;
  - a video call. `inc/cotour.php` and `inc/flagship-cotour.php` sync state only, with no audio or video.
  - official floor plans for Rainbow; the developer's data is awaited, with the owner contacting ישראל קנדה.
- **Money rails overlap:** `offers.php`, `auction.php`, `auction-upsell.php`, `placement-auction.php`, `placements.php`, `sponsored-spot.php` and `featured-upsell.php`. No fifth rail. The per-apartment campaign room builds on `advertiser-center.php` and `advertiser-orders.php` after a consolidation decision.
- **The first small slice Claude proposes for Codex's lab:** the unit contract, and a prototype of the section cut on a copy of `assets/project-stage/rainbow/stage.js` (three.js clipping planes). Measure pick precision, identity continuity (the URL, the `nl:*` events, GA, the WhatsApp text, the RFP payload), FPS and weight on a mid Android.

### Claude's current queue (the loop, 27.9)

1. ~~Rainbow phone polish~~: **live 1.72.280.** The accessibility button is a fixed floating control; it covers whatever scrolls under it, which is expected.
2. ~~The homepage film band~~: **live 1.72.281.**
3. ~~The view answers questions~~: **live 1.72.282.** The labels in the view and the list under it are in `assets/project-stage/bridge.js` (`showNear`, `addViewPins`).
